## Overview of the analysis

Pewlett Hackard (HP) is a large company with a lot of employees, some of them are starting to retire, thus, HP needs to face this new scenario on two fronts: 

1) Offer a retirement package for those who meet certain retirement criteria. 
2) Identify positions that will need to be filled when retirements arrive. 

To support this transition, we have already identified employees that will be retiring soon and the number of positions that needs to be filled, nevertheless, we received two additional requests: 

1) Determine the number of retiring employees per title.
2) Identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.
