# Challenge7

## Overview of the analysis

Pewlett Hackard (HP) is a large company with a lot of employees, some of them are starting to retire, thus, HP needs to face this new scenario on two fronts: 

1) Offer a retirement package for those who meet certain retirement criteria. 
2) Identify positions that will need to be filled when retirements arrive. 

To support this transition, we have already identified employees that will be retiring soon and the number of positions that needs to be filled, nevertheless, we received two additional requests: 

1) Determine the number of retiring employees per title.
2) Identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.

## Results

To face this challenge, we used 6 CSV basis provided by the different departments containing general information about employees: Name, Last Name, Hiring Date, Title, Department, etc. This information was worked in useful tables using SQL to help answers the questions. 

### Results of 1st Analysis

About positions we are going to offer retirement packages: 

1) We only have two Managers about to retire. 
2) Most of the upcoming retirements are in Senior positions both Engineer and Staff. 

### Results of 2nd Analysis

To fill these positions, if we consider employees born during 1965:
1) We have some senior Staff and Engineers eligible to be elegible. 
2) Total eligible candidates are quite lower than coming retirements. 

## Summary

As seen before: 

1) Total expected retirements > 90,000 employees. 
2) Elegible employees for mentorship < 2,000 employees.

Is easy to see current mentorship program won't outcome enough employees to fill the upcoming open positions driven by the "silver tsunami" of retirement. 

The Human Resources team with Top Management needs to define the strategy to follow but basically, options are a mix of: 

1) Soften requirements to eligible programs to reach a broader branch of current employees. 
2) Start recruiting senior positions to catch up with forecoming retirement employees.
